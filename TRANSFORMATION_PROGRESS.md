3. Update environment variables and security features

## ‚úÖ **Phase 7: Critical Schema Fixes (COMPLETED)**

### **Issues Resolved:**
- **Billing Endpoints**: Fixed nested response structure to match frontend expectations
- **User Settings**: Fixed import path and added error handling for missing user fields
- **Analytics Routes**: Fixed database queries for non-existent workspace_id columns
- **API Response Formats**: Standardized all endpoints to return expected data structures

### **Technical Fixes Applied:**
1. **Backend Billing Routes** (`backend/routes/billing.py`)
   - `/api/plans` now returns flat array instead of nested object
   - `/api/my-subscription` now returns flat subscription structure
   - Added proper datetime handling and default values

2. **Backend User Settings** (`backend/routes/settings.py`)
   - Fixed import from `routes.auth` to `utils.auth_utils`
   - Added error handling and default values for missing user fields
   - Robust fallback for null/undefined user preferences

3. **Backend Analytics Routes** (`backend/routes/analytics.py`)
   - Disabled workspace_id filtering for tables that don't have this column
   - Fixed database queries to work with current schema

4. **Frontend API Client** (`frontend-nextjs/src/lib/api.ts`)
   - Fixed endpoint paths to match backend routes
   - Updated response handling for new data structures

### **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Billing System**: Fully functional with correct data structures
- ‚úÖ **User Settings**: Working with proper error handling
- ‚úÖ **Analytics**: Dashboard metrics loading correctly
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: All critical endpoints responding correctly
- ‚úÖ **Docker Environment**: All containers running and healthy

## üéØ Key Decisions Made

1. **Preserve All Security**: Keep all existing security features (JWT, 2FA, rate limiting)
2. **Reuse AI Pipeline**: Adapt existing GPT integration rather than rebuilding
3. **Maintain PWA**: Keep offline functionality and mobile app capabilities
4. **Keep Stripe Integration**: Adapt existing billing system for contract-based usage
5. **Minimal Database Changes**: Create new table, migrate gradually, avoid breaking changes

## üìù Notes

- All HOA-specific terminology has been removed from user-facing content
- Database and network names updated for consistency
- Pricing structure adapted for contract review use case
- File storage configuration updated for document handling
- PWA functionality preserved for mobile/offline use
