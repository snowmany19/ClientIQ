# Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
# macOS: brew install postgresql
# Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install postgresql
# Windows: Use the official installer

# Start PostgreSQL service
# macOS: brew services start postgresql
# Ubuntu: sudo service postgresql start

# Create database and user
psql postgres
# In psql shell:
CREATE DATABASE civicloghoa_db;
CREATE USER civicloghoa_user WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE civicloghoa_db TO civicloghoa_user;
\q
```

### 3. **Configure Environment Variables**
```bash
cd backend
cp env_example.txt .env
# Edit .env and set:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://civicloghoa_user:yourpassword@localhost:5432/civicloghoa_db
# (Fill in all other required secrets: Stripe, OpenAI, etc.)
```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. **Run Database Migrations**
```bash
cd ../backend
alembic upgrade head
```

### 6. **Seed the Database (Optional)**
```bash
python init_db.py
```

### 7. **Run the Application**

# Backend (FastAPI)
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Frontend (Streamlit)
cd ../frontend
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

## üè≠ Production Deployment
- Set `ENVIRONMENT=production` and `DEBUG=false` in `.env`
- Use a secure, production PostgreSQL instance
- Set strong secrets for `SECRET_KEY`, Stripe, and OpenAI
- Configure CORS and email settings as needed
- Use a process manager (e.g., Gunicorn, systemd) for backend
- Use HTTPS in production
- See `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` for advanced deployment

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Handoff & Ownership
- All code, data, and configuration are now ready for transfer
- `.env` contains all secrets and environment-specific settings (never commit this file)
- See `PERFORMANCE_NOTES.md` for scaling and optimization
- See `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md` for security best practices
- All migration/test scripts are included in `backend/`
- For questions, contact the original developer (see Support)
- **Please review the [Terms of Sale](TERMS_OF_SALE.md) before completing your purchase.**

---

## üß™ Testing
- Run all backend tests:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  pip install -r requirements-test.txt
  python run_tests.py
  ```
- Coverage reports are generated in `backend/htmlcov/`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
- **401 Unauthorized:** Ensure users exist in PostgreSQL (migrate from SQLite if needed)
- **DB Connection Errors:** Check `DATABASE_URL` and that PostgreSQL is running
- **Migrations Fail:** Ensure Alembic is configured for PostgreSQL and DB is empty/clean
- **Stripe/OpenAI Issues:** Double-check API keys in `.env`
- **Frontend Not Loading:** Ensure Streamlit is running and CORS is configured
