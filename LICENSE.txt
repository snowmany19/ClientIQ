2. BRAND & VERTICAL OWNERSHIP
   The Licensee is granted full commercial ownership rights to the A.I.ncident name, logo, UI theme, and associated visual branding provided at the time of sale.

"Vertical" is defined as a specific industry or market segment (e.g., retail incident tracking, dental compliance, school security reporting).
This exclusivity applies only to the vertical defined at time of sale.

2.1 VERTICAL SCOPE LIMITATION
The Licensee is granted exclusive rights to the A.I.ncident software within the vertical of **retail incident reporting**, defined as tools specifically designed for managing in-store physical security events (e.g., theft, safety, employee-related incidents) in retail settings.

3. MODULAR ENGINE IP RETENTION

* The Licensee may not extract, repackage, or resell the engine as a template, starter kit, or framework
* The Licensee may not reverse-engineer the codebase to build competing products in other verticals
* Security Flaw Solutions LLC may reuse all non-vertical-specific code in other SaaS products or projects

4. NO WARRANTY & FINAL SALE
   The software is sold as-is, without warranty or guarantees.

* All sales are final and non-refundable
* Security Flaw Solutions LLC is not responsible for hosting, deployment, support, uptime, or third-party integrations (e.g., Stripe, OpenAI)
* No post-sale support is included unless separately agreed in writing

5. OPTIONAL PAID SERVICES
   Additional services such as deployment assistance, prompt tuning, branding updates, multi-tenant features, or enhancements may be offered at Security Flaw Solutions LLC's discretion for an additional fee.
