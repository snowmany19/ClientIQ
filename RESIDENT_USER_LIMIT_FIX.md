# Resident User Limit Fix

## Issue
Previously, **residents were counting toward the user limit** in the HOA-log platform, which was incorrect since residents are end-users who view their violations and shouldn't consume admin user licenses.

## Problem Details
The user limit calculation was counting ALL users regardless of role:
- `inspector` - HOA staff who create violations
- `hoa_board` - HOA board members  
- `admin` - System administrators
- `resident` - Residents who view their violations ❌ **Was being counted**

## Solution
Updated the user limit calculations to **exclude residents** from the count.

### Files Modified:

1. **`backend/utils/plan_enforcement.py`**
   - Updated `check_user_limit()` function
   - Updated `get_usage_stats()` function
   - Added filter: `User.role != "resident"`

2. **`backend/routes/billing.py`**
   - Updated `get_usage_stats()` function
   - Updated `get_usage_limits_route()` function
   - Added SQL filter: `WHERE hoa_id = :hoa_id AND role != 'resident'`

## User Roles Clarification

### **Admin Users** (Count toward limit):
- **Inspectors** - Create and manage violations
- **HOA Board Members** - Oversee HOA operations
- **System Administrators** - Manage the platform

### **Residents** (Do NOT count toward limit):
- **Residents** - View their own violations and letters
- These are end-users who consume the service, not admin users

## Impact

### **Before Fix:**
- Starter Plan (2 users): Could only have 2 total users including residents
- Business Plan (5 users): Could only have 5 total users including residents
- This severely limited the number of residents who could access the platform

### **After Fix:**
- Starter Plan (2 users): Can have 2 admin users + unlimited residents
- Business Plan (5 users): Can have 5 admin users + unlimited residents
- Pro Plan (10 users): Can have 10 admin users + unlimited residents
- Enterprise Plan (20 users): Can have 20 admin users + unlimited residents

## Example Scenarios

### **Small HOA (Starter Plan - $99/month)**
- **Admin Users:** 2 (1 inspector + 1 board member)
- **Residents:** 25 (unlimited, but plan limits to 25 units)
- **Total Cost:** $99/month

### **Medium HOA (Business Plan - $299/month)**
- **Admin Users:** 5 (2 inspectors + 2 board members + 1 manager)
- **Residents:** 100 (unlimited, but plan limits to 100 units)
- **Total Cost:** $299/month

### **Large HOA (Pro Plan - $499/month)**
- **Admin Users:** 10 (3 inspectors + 3 board members + 2 managers + 2 assistants)
- **Residents:** 250 (unlimited, but plan limits to 250 units)
- **Total Cost:** $499/month

## Benefits

1. **More Realistic Pricing:** HOAs can have many residents without hitting user limits
2. **Better Value:** Admin users are the ones who need licenses, not residents
3. **Scalability:** Large HOAs can serve hundreds of residents with reasonable admin user limits
4. **Clear Separation:** Distinguishes between service providers (admin users) and service consumers (residents)

## Testing

The fix has been deployed and tested:
- ✅ User limit calculations now exclude residents
- ✅ Usage statistics show correct admin user counts
- ✅ Billing dashboard displays accurate user limits
- ✅ Plan enforcement works correctly for admin users only

## Conclusion

This fix makes the pricing model much more realistic and valuable for HOAs. Now the user limits apply only to administrative users who actively manage the platform, while residents can access their violation information without consuming licenses.
